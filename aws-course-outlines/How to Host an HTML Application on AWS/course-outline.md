## ðŸ“š Course Title  
1. How to Host an HTML Application on AWS (Full Step-by-Step Project)

Welcome to "How to Host an HTML Application on AWS" â€” a full step-by-step project for beginners.  
In this course, youâ€™ll learn how to build and deploy a secure HTML web application using core AWS services.  
 
First, weâ€™ll set up networking using a custom VPC, public and private subnets, an Internet Gateway, a NAT Gateway, and route tables to manage traffic.  
 
Then, youâ€™ll use S3 to store the HTML application code, and configure an IAM role to allow secure access from your EC2 instance.  
 
After that, weâ€™ll launch and connect to a Linux EC2 instance using SSH keys, and install the application from S3 onto the server.  
 
Finally, youâ€™ll clean up all the AWS resources to avoid unnecessary charges.  
 
Letâ€™s get started and bring your project to life on AWS!
